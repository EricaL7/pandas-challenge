# pandas-challenge

Regarding outside assitance on this challenge, I had a great tutoring session with Simon Rennocks. 
Other than that, I was able to complete the challenge referencing my notes.

For this project, we are looking to identify potential factors that would contribute to a student's success in high school.
Student success was defined using reading and math test scores.
The three variables considered are: budget per student, school size, and school type. 
After cleaning the data, the data was used to explore correlations between student success and these three variables. 
There was also a drill down section to see each school success by grade year.
